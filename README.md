# Monkey
  things i share to do some stuff. if it is a user script, intall Tamper Monkey in your browser to use it.
  
  wlxt_theme_tool to get you a better Tsinghua wlxt experience
  
  that exam arrangement script allows you to filter all test arrangements on info, because I don't know why they didn't have a search button for that webpage :( 
  
  .sh is a translated version of doubi script
  
  yeketang_theme_tool is a grease monkey script that i wrote to change the theme of yuketang(https://pro.yuketang.cn/web?index), well, just like that wlxt_theme_tool. But I made a way friendlier UI as well as a daily quote thing. It's a birthday present for a friend :)
