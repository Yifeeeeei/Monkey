# Monkey
  things i share to do some stuff. if it is a user script, intall Tamper Monkey in your browser to use it.
  
  Most things here are user scripts designed for students at my campus. Well, to make things nicer.
  
  wlxt_theme_tool to get you a better Tsinghua wlxt experience
  
  that exam arrangement script allows you to filter all test arrangements on info, because I don't know why they didn't have a search button for that webpage :( 
  
  trojan is a script I copied a long time ago. It was written by someone else, however it got deleted. Luckily I still have one here. It allows you to create your own proxy server.
  
  yeketang_theme_tool is a grease monkey script that i wrote to change the theme of yuketang(https://pro.yuketang.cn/web?index), well, just like that wlxt_theme_tool. But I made a way friendlier UI as well as a daily quote thing. A birthday present for a friend :)

  csdn_free_copy is a grease monkey script that allows you to copy code block from csdn without the requested logging in step.
